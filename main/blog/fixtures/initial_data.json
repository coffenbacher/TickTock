They can listen while you play and visa-versa. Asking your instrumental teacher to come along is never a bad idea.\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<b>Do your homework</b><br />\r\nFind out as much as you can about the instrument by using Google and asking your teacher/friends. Try to find out what the average selling price is for the instrument you are interested in.\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<b>Test the instrument properly</b><br />\r\nMake sure you have a plan before you visit, this means deciding on what you will play on the instrument when you test it out. Making sure the repertoire is varied is important.\r\n</li>\r\n<li><b>Haggle</b><br />\r\nIf you have seen the same instrument in the same condition selling for less, then write down where and take it along and show the seller. Perhaps they won\u2019t reduce the price but it is worth a try.\r\n</li>\r\n<li><b>Written proof of purchase</b><br />\r\nAnything officially proving purchase, including certificates, receipts etc\u2026 is preferred\r\n</li>\r\n<li><b>Decide on the most important things that you\u2019re looking for</b><br />\r\nKnowing what you want from your next instrument is important, because it allows you to focus on searching for those requirements, rather than having too wide a scope.\r\n</li><li><b>Start with a budget</b><br />\r\nDeciding on how much you have to spend will again help in focusing more acutely on the vast amount of good instruments that are available.\r\n</li><li><b>Value for money</b><br />\r\nIs the instrument a bargain? If not then it\u2019s perhaps better to continue searching.\r\n</li><li><b>Insure the instrument</b><br />\r\nOnce you have decided to take the plunge and invest a lot of money into your instrument, then don\u2019t forget to insure it just in case anything bad does happen.\r\n</li><li><b>Get the full details of the instrument</b><br />\r\nAsk the seller as much as possible about the instrument they are selling. Ask them why they are selling and ask them to play on the instrument. What do they like/dislike about the instrument?\r\n</li><li><b>Don\u2019t buy if uncertain</b><br />\r\nIf you have doubts then don\u2019t buy immediately. If need be, visit the seller again and test the instrument again until you are confident that it is the right decision. Don\u2019t forget that, thanks to the internet, the choice available to musicians is much larger than it has ever been.\r\n</li>", "author": 1, "modified": "2012-11-30T06:17:47.660Z", "created": "2012-11-30T06:04:32.425Z"}}]
